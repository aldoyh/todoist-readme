## Setup

### Prep work

1. You'll need a Todoist API Token. You can get that from [here](https://beta.todoist.com/prefs/integrations)
   - if you're new to Todoist, then you can refer [here](#new-to-todoist).
2. You need to save the Todoist API Token in the repository secrets. You can find that in the Settings of your Repository. Be sure to save those as the following.
   - `TODOIST_API_KEY = <your todoist API token>`
3. You need to update the README file(README.md) with 2 comments. You can refer [here](#update-your-readme) for updating it.

## Update your README

Add a comment to your `README.md` like this:

```markdown
# Todoist Stats
